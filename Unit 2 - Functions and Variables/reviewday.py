#two basic funcionts
#yk its a function because it has () at the end
#the stuff in the () are called parameters
#parameter are information that the function needs to run
# i say jump, you say how high? how high is the paramter 
print("skibidi toilet")     #skibidi toilet is the parameter
input("what did fanum do\n>")   #\n is called an escape character or line break
#input is never required, only use it when necessary


# variables
#variables are a way to store data for later use in the program
#syntax (garmmer)
#<name> = <value>
x = 5  # x is the variabl name, and 5 is the value

# snake naming convention - all lowercase, underscores for spaces
# CONCISE: short and descriptive
username = "alberts" #define string (string of character)
fav_animal = "calugo" # define string 
total_poptarts = 23.6 #define integer (whole number)
percent_complete = 12 #define float (decimal)
is_cool = True #define boolean (true/false)
first_letter = 'c' #define character #single keyboard symbol

total_poptars = 8 #reassigning variable

#arithmetic operators (sounds scary, but just math)
# + - * / ** % //
print(2 + 2)  #>8
print("2" + "2")   #>22
print("cat" + "dog")
print("cat" * 3) #catcatcat

my_variable = 2 + 3 #arithmetic operations can be done anywhere


#make some working programs
#1 add two numbers using input
x = input("what is x?\n") #input function always returns a string
x = int(x)
y = input("what is y?\n>") #even if you types in a number
y = int(y)
print(x + y)



name = "jaskon"
last_name = "alberts"
print(name + last_name)

#bolean expressions are like mathematical formula
# 14 + 10 = 24
# can only evaluate to true or false
# 5 > 10 = false

print(5 > 10) #boolean algebra
print(14 + 10) #algebra

x = 5 # SET x equal to 5, telling it what to be
print(x == 5) #GET x equal to 5, ask a question


# THIS IS THE PERFECT TEST QUESTION
# what is the difference between = and  == ?

print(4 >= 2) #true
print(1933 == 1933) #true
print(-90 < -99) #fa;se
print(10 != 10) #false, "not"
